    <div class="content">
      <p>Apparently, it takes a village to raise a child. Frankly, if we’d known how much work putting together the biggest Minecraft update yet was going to be, we’d have probably taken the easy option and tried to raise that child instead.<br /></p>

<p>But it was all worth it for this, <strong>Village &amp; Pillage</strong> Update release day! I can almost hear the Pillagers firing their crossbows into the air in celebration! Or are they firing them towards me…<br /></p>

<p>Enjoy the update!<br /></p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>The tide is coming in at last! That’s sea-faring speak for ‘Java Players! Today you get the full Update Aquatic!’<br /></p>

<p>There’s a whole new ocean of features, impatiently waiting for you to dive in! Take a delightful swim with dolphins and tropical fish. Explore mysterious ruins and tragic shipwrecks while hunting for new deep-sea treasures. Meet turtles on the shore and defend their eggs from mobs with the new trident!<br /></p>

<p>Trust us, you’ll want that new weapon. Because our biggest ocean update ever has also made these seas much more dangerous places to explore. Get too distracted by the colourful coral, and you might get dragged down to the ocean floor by bubble columns. Which could result in introducing yourself to the Drowned. What are the Drowned? Why not swim down to the ocean floor and find out? After you!<br /></p>

<p>Still, at least you’re safe on land! Well, as long as you get enough sleep. Otherwise, you might meet The Phantom, the mob you voted into Minecraft last year. Be careful what you wish for, and enjoy the update!<br /></p>

<p><strong>Changelog:</strong><br />
* All undead mobs now sink<br />
* Changed underwater visibility<br />
* Overhauled world generation<br />

    <div class="content">
      <p>Sunlight yellow, chili red, royal blue, midnight black, grass green, lilac purple, true lime, fresh salmon, hot cappuccino, pretty much all of the off-white, annoying cyan, alpha-tested magenta, that brown-greenish barf shade… the World of Color update is here! (Minecraft Java Edition 1.12, editor’s note.)<br /></p>

<p>With this update we bring you a fresh take on all the colored blocks in Minecraft, using the infamous “Jonni Palette 0.2” for wool, sheep, shulker boxes, and banners, and introducing glazed terracotta, colored beds, and colored concrete. These bring you many new options to building colorful creations in your meticulously planned spawn area.<br /></p>

<p>We asked the community to show us what they could do with the new blocks - and the results were a technicolour triumph! We took some of our favourites and put them in the trailer below!<br /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dQuIIUT-o">World of Color Trailer</a><br /></p>

<p>The World of Color update also introduces the recipe book and a whole new advancements system. These will help guiding your way through the adventure of Minecraft, and can be utilized by creators to make interesting custom adventure maps and mini games.<br /></p>

<p>And lets not forget, parrots! :partyparrot:<br /></p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>With the approaching transition from Mojang accounts to Microsoft accounts, we will need to end support for Windows XP and Windows Vista. This will also result in the end of support for the legacy launcher. You can read more about the account migration here -&gt; <a href="https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360050865492-JAVA-Account-Migration-FAQ">https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360050865492-JAVA-Account-Migration-FAQ</a></p>
